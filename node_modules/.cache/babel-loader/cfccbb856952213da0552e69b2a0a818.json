NDNU is a fully accredited, private, Catholic, co-educational master\\u2019s university, located on the San Francisco Peninsula in Silicon Valley. With approximately 1,700 students from 29 states and 32 different countries, NDNU broadens the perspective and outlook of its students by exposing them to peers with very different backgrounds, cultures and world views. At NDNU, smaller class sizes, ranging from 12 to 25, means that students receive personal attention from excellent instructors in challenging courses that cover a wide range of academic programs. Our professors don\\u2019t just teach; they are committed to help advise and mentor you through your college journey. Our location offers learning opportunities and internships that can\\u2019t be found anywhere else. NDNU also has two extension locations with partner colleges, and recently added online graduate programs. NDNU strives not only for excellence in academics, but also to challenge its students to be extraordinary forces for change in the community. This is accomplished through a variety of community-based learning programs that redefine the concept of \\u201Chands-on\\u201D learning and connect students with programs that allow them to make positive contributions to the community. Our students are active outside of the classroom in more than 30 student organizations spanning academics, ethnic, sports, professional, social and service groups. Student athletes participate in 12 NCAA Division II sports, and students in visual and performing arts present a varied calendar of events throughout the year. At NDNU, all students are given the tools they need to succeed in college and life.
